so the intuition in this problem is that when the baloons are intersecting then there is 1 arrow needed for all these intersecting balloons, but we cannot keep merging the intervals into one because the a third interval that is merging with second interval might not have an intersection for the first interval, so in that case if we merge two and three, then the baloon one will need a new arrow. So that is why merging will not work here and we will always use the first end or the last end point where we have a new arrow as the reference for deciding whether this baloon point is overlapping and can be shot with the old arrow itself.
