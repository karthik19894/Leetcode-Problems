So to solve this problem we need to see if the robot is moving in a circle , but it doesn't matter how large the circle is, so we can say that robot moves in a circle if the robot has come back to the origin after one cycle or if the direction of the robot has changed from the one at start(North), since there is no bound, any direction change should always make the robot move within a circle when the same instructions are repeated again and again.
